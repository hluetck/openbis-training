# Analysing data stored in openBIS with Jupyter Notebooks, Python or MATLAB

## Jupyter notebooks
Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive, web-based computing environment that combine code, results and documentation in a single document. Jupyter notebooks support a lot of different programming languages. For more details and installation instructions, see https://jupyter.org/

A tutorial describing how to analyse data stored in openBIS is available: [openBIS-Jupyter-Tutorial](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/sis-rdm-training/openbis-training/-/wikis/openBIS-Jupyter-Tutorial)

## Python
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language that is becoming increasingly popular in the scienctific community. pyBIS is a Python module for interacting with openBIS. For details / documentation, see https://sissource.ethz.ch/sispub/openbis/tree/master/pybis 

## MATLAB
[MATLAB](https://ch.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a numerical computing environment and programming language developed by MathWorks. ETH SIS has developed a toolbox for accessing data stored in openBIS from MATLAB: https://sissource.ethz.ch/hluetcke/matlab-openbis
