# Analysing data stored in openBIS with Jupyter Notebooks or Matlab

## Jupyter notebooks
Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive, web-based computing environment that combine code, results and documentation in a single document. Jupyter notebooks support a lot of different programming languages. For more details and installation instructions, see https://jupyter.org/

Once you have installed Jupyter on your computer / analysis server, you can install the openBIS Jupyter extension from pyPI:
`pip install jupyter-openbis-extension`

An example notebook that demonstrates the analysis of data stored in openBIS is provided in this repository: [Jupyter_Demo_Notebook.ipynb](Jupyter_Demo_Notebook.ipynb). For a static version, download [Jupyter_Demo_Notebook.html](Jupyter_Demo_Notebook.html).
